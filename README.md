# RPG Game Development Adventure in Javascript

I wanted to learn how to develop a game then I just started the learning with [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Iq0TcMdvBw) tutorial I found.


### 1. Day
 - [x] Downloaded and installed NodeJS, Yarn and [starter repo](https://github.com/dajack05/simple-dev-starter).
 - [x] Integrated rpg sprite set in the [opengameart.org](https://opengameart.org/content/antifareas-rpg-sprite-set-1-enlarged-w-transparent-background)
 - [x] Character, animations, controllers, basic movement is done.
 - [x] Character movement animation improved more than tutorial (When you release the key, the animation stops in player direction).
